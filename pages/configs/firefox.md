### Extensions

#### Privacy

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) – Efficient general-purpose ad blocker.
- [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/) – Guide to enhancing the privacy of Firefox.

#### Utility

- [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) – Give almost every site a dark mode.
- [Foxy Gestures](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxy-gestures/) – Because I used Opera just long enough (a long time ago) to get used to mouse gestures.
- [Amazon SMILE!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon-smile/) – Automatically redirect Amazon to Amazon Smile so I can donate to charity without all the bloat of the Amazon Assitant extension.
- [Kee](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keefox/) – Because KeePass is the best FOSS password manager.
- [Enhancer for YouTube™](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/) – Lots of experience improvements on YouTube.
- [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) – Stylesheet injection when Dark Reader doesn't cut it.
